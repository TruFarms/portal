## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep navy blue (#2E3192) to convey trust, professionalism, and reliability.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F2F5) to provide a clean, neutral backdrop that mirrors pharmaceutical environments.
- Accent color: Soft periwinkle (#B2B1F3) to highlight key interactive elements such as buttons and links without being visually distracting.
- Body font: 'Inter', sans-serif for a clean, modern, and highly readable text.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif, lending a tech-forward but accessible appearance, suitable for a modern cannabis manufacturing brand.
- Use line icons inspired by the regulated industries (pharma, biotech) for services and product categories, reinforcing a sense of expertise.
- Implement a grid-based layout with generous spacing to ensure content is easily digestible and the overall design feels uncluttered and professional.
